# Distributed AI Platform - Implementation Summary

## What Was Created

This implementation provides a complete distributed AI platform designed to run across 10 machines in your home lab. Here's what has been delivered:

### Core Components

1. **Complete Docker Compose Configurations**
   - Base configuration with common settings
   - Machine-specific configurations for all 10 machines
   - Proper service distribution based on hardware capabilities

2. **Service Implementations**
   - Service Registry (no HashiCorp dependencies)
   - Service Registrar for automatic registration
   - Sequential Thinking OpenAPI server
   - Health check and monitoring systems

3. **Deployment Automation**
   - Comprehensive deployment script with safety checks
   - Health check script for all services
   - Database backup automation
   - Model loading scripts

4. **Monitoring Stack**
   - Prometheus configuration for metrics collection
   - Grafana for visualization
   - Loki for log aggregation
   - Alertmanager for notifications

5. **Documentation**
   - Architecture guide explaining design decisions
   - Step-by-step deployment guide
   - Troubleshooting procedures

## Key Features Implemented

### Load Balancing
- LiteLLM intelligently routes requests across 4 Ollama instances
- Model-based routing (large models to Hades)
- Health-based failover
- External API fallback support

### High Availability
- PostgreSQL streaming replication
- No single point of failure for critical services
- Automatic service discovery via DNS
- Health monitoring with auto-recovery

### Security
- API key authentication throughout
- Network isolation with Docker networks
- Reverse proxy with Traefik
- Encrypted secrets management

### Scalability
- Easy addition of new GPU nodes
- Horizontal scaling for OpenAPI servers
- Centralized model storage prevents duplication
- Distributed architecture allows growth

## How to Deploy

1. **Initial Setup**
   ```bash
   git clone <repo> /opt/ai-platform
   cd /opt/ai-platform
   chmod +x setup.sh
   ./setup.sh
   ```

2. **Configure Environment**
   - Edit `.env` with your specific values
   - Set up NFS mounts to TrueNAS

3. **Deploy Services** (in order)
   ```bash
   ./scripts/deploy.sh erebus      # Databases first
   ./scripts/deploy.sh hephaestus  # Edge services
   ./scripts/deploy.sh thanatos    # Secondary services
   ./scripts/deploy.sh zelus       # Additional services
   ./scripts/deploy.sh orpheus     # Primary GPU
   ./scripts/deploy.sh kratos      # GPU node
   ./scripts/deploy.sh nyx         # GPU node
   ./scripts/deploy.sh hades       # AMD GPU
   ./scripts/deploy.sh moros       # Monitoring
   ./scripts/deploy.sh local       # Workstation
   ```

4. **Verify Deployment**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/health-check.sh all
   ```

## Access Points

- **Open-WebUI**: http://orpheus.local:3000
- **Grafana**: http://moros.local:3001
- **Prometheus**: http://moros.local:9090
- **Uptime Kuma**: http://hephaestus.local:3001
- **LiteLLM API**: http://orpheus.local:4000

## What Makes This Special

1. **Fully Open Source**: No proprietary dependencies or licensing concerns
2. **Distributed by Design**: Leverages all available hardware efficiently
3. **Production Ready**: Includes monitoring, backups, and health checks
4. **Flexible**: Easy to add new services or scale existing ones
5. **Secure**: Multiple layers of authentication and network isolation
6. **Cost Effective**: One-time hardware investment vs ongoing cloud costs

## Next Steps

1. Review and customize the `.env` file
2. Ensure all machines can resolve `.local` domains
3. Set up NFS shares on TrueNAS
4. Deploy services following the deployment guide
5. Load your preferred models
6. Start using your private AI platform!

## Support Files Included

- Environment template with all configurable options
- Service registry for dynamic discovery
- Health checking across all services
- Automated backup scripts
- Model loading automation
- Comprehensive monitoring
- Security best practices

## Important Notes

- Models are stored centrally on NAS - ensure adequate storage
- GPU drivers must be installed before deployment
- Database passwords are auto-generated on first setup
- All services auto-register with the service registry
- Monitoring dashboards are pre-configured

This platform provides enterprise-grade AI capabilities while maintaining complete control over your data and infrastructure. The distributed architecture ensures high availability and performance while the open-source foundation guarantees long-term sustainability.

Happy deploying! ðŸš€
